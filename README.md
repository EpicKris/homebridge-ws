## Homebridge plugin for virtual weather station
Copyright Â© 2018 Erik Baauw. All rights reserved.

This [homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge) plugin exposes a virtual weather station to Apple's [HomeKit](http://www.apple.com/ios/home/).  It mimics an Eve Degree, providing separate services for Temperature, Humidity, and Air Pressure.  Temperature and Humidity are supported Apple's [Home](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204893) app and by Siri.  For Air Pressure you need another app, like like [Eve](https://www.evehome.com/en/eve-app).  In Eve, you also get history for Temperature, Humidity and Air Pressure.  The weather is retrieved from [Wunderground](https://www.wunderground.com) and/or [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org).

There's many other weather station plugins out there.  I created this one for fun and for testing plugin designs.  In particular, this plugin is the launching plugin for [homebridge-lib](https://github.com/ebaauw/homebridge-lib).

### Configuration
In homebridge's `config.json` you need to specify homebridge-ws as a platform plugin.  Furthermore, you need to specify your Wunderground [API key](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/pricing.html) and [location(s)](https://www.wunderground.com/weather/api/d/docs?d=data/geolookup&MR=1#location) and/or your OpenWeatherMap [API key](https://openweathermap.org/price), and [location(s)](https://openweathermap.org/current):
```json
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "WS",
      "name": "Weather",
      "wunderground": {
        "apikey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "locations": ["AMS"]
      },
      "openweathermap": {
        "apikey": "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
        "locations": ["Amsterdam"]
      }
    }
  ]
```
